## Resubmission

Hello,  
This is the **second** submission.


### CRAN's first feedback by "Uwe Ligges" was:

"Please explain in your Description field:
What are "ActiLife counts"? If there is a web reference for ActiLife, 
please add it in the firm <https://......> to the Description field."

### In the second submission:
The Description field is updated according to the instructions.  
Also, the version number is increased.








## Test Environments

### On win-builder

1. R-devel
2. R-release
3. R-oldrelease



### On Travis CI

1. Checked in *Linux* for both old releases and release 
2. Checked in *OSX* for both old releases and release

### With Rhub
Checked for the followings:
  
1. Debian Linux, R-devel, clang
2. Debian Linux, R-release, GCC
3. Fedora Linux, R-devel, GCC



## Check results:
- There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.   
- There is only one *NOTE* :  
Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION:  
  ActiLife (3:17, 12:14, 14:65, 15:3, 16:21)  
  Actigraph (12:81, 13:3)  
  Brond (17:30)  
  accelerometer (15:91, 16:78)  
  accelerometers (12:91, 13:54)  
 

## Regarding the check results:
This is OK. I checked them, and none of them is miss-spelling.  
  **ActiLife** is a software's name.   
  **Actigraph** is an accelerometer brand.  
  **Brond** is a proper name.  
  Also, an **accelerometer** is an instrument for measuring acceleration.  
  
  
Thank you for your time

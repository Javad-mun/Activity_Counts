## Resubmission

Hello,  
This is the second submission.


### CRAN's first comment by "Uwe Ligges" was:

"Please explain in your Description field:
What are "ActiLife counts"? If there is a web reference for ActiLife, 
please add it in the firm <https://......> to the Description field."

### Actions I took
The Description field is updated according to the instructions.








## Test Environments

### On win-builder

1. R-devel
2. R-release
3. R-oldrelease



### On Travis CI

1. Checked in *Linux* for both old releases and release 
2. Checked in *OSX* for both old releases and release

### With Rhub
Checked for the followings:
  
1. Debian Linux, R-devel, clang
2. Debian Linux, R-release, GCC
3. Fedora Linux, R-devel, GCC



## Check results:
- There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.   
- There is only one *NOTE* :  
Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION:  
  ActiLife (3:19, 7:22)  
  Brond (7:123) 

#### This is OK, **ActiLife** is a software's name, and it is not misspelled. Also **Brond** is a proper name and it is not misspelled.
  
  
Thank you for your time
